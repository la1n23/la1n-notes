# Additional sources
Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:
* Passwords in `Group Policy` in the `SYSVOL` share
* Passwords in scripts in the `SYSVOL` share
* Password in scripts on IT shares
* Passwords in `web.config` files on dev machines and IT shares
* `unattend.xml`
* Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
* KeePass databases --> pull hash, crack and get loads of access.
* Found on user systems and shares
* Files such as pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, Sharepoint
