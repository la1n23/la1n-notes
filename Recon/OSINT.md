* S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. The owner of the files can set access permissions to either make files public, private and even writable. Sometimes these access permissions are incorrectly set and inadvertently allow access to files that shouldn't be available to the public. The format of the S3 buckets is http(s)://**{name}.**[**s3.amazonaws.com**](http://s3.amazonaws.com/) where {name} is decided by the owner, such as [tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com](http://tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com). S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the process. One common automation method is by using the company name followed by common terms such as **{name}**-assets, **{name}**-www, **{name}**-public, **{name}**-private, etc. [[s3]]

- **Footholds**  
    Consider [GHDB-ID: 6364](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/6364) as it uses the query `intitle:"index of" "nginx.log"` to discover Nginx logs and might reveal server misconfigurations that can be exploited.
- **Files Containing Usernames**  
    For example, [GHDB-ID: 7047](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/7047) uses the search term `intitle:"index of" "contacts.txt"` to discover files that leak juicy information.
- **Sensitive Directories**  
    For example, consider [GHDB-ID: 6768](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/6768), which uses the search term `inurl:/certs/server.key` to find out if a private RSA key is exposed.
- **Web Server Detection**  
    Consider [GHDB-ID: 6876](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/6876), which detects GlassFish Server information using the query `intitle:"GlassFish Server - Server Running"`.
- **Vulnerable Files**  
    For example, we can try to locate PHP files using the query `intitle:"index of" "*.php"`, as provided by [GHDB-ID: 7786](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/7786).
- **Vulnerable Servers**  
    For instance, to discover SolarWinds Orion web consoles, [GHDB-ID: 6728](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/6728) uses the query `intext:"user name" intext:"orion core" -solarwinds.com`.
- **Error Messages**  
    Plenty of useful information can be extracted from error messages. One example is [GHDB-ID: 5963](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/5963), which uses the query `intitle:"index of" errors.log` to find log files related to errors.
